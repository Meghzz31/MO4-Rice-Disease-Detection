            Rice is a staple food for millions worldwide, yet its productivity
            and quality are often threatened by diseases. This issue is
            particularly significant in Dakshina Kannada, Karnataka, known for
            its extensive cultivation of the MO4 rice variety, which is highly
            susceptible to diseases such as bacterial leaf blight, sheath
            blight, and neck blast. Early and accurate detection of these
            diseases is essential for effective management strategies. To
            address this, we propose a deep learning- based model leveraging
            convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the reliable identification
            and classification of rice leaf diseases. Our research involved
            compiling a comprehensive dataset of healthy and diseased MO4 rice
            leaf images, meticulously annotated for precision. By fine-tuning
            state-of-the-art CNNs, the model demonstrates high accuracy,
            precision, recall, and F1 score in detecting diseases. Extensive
            testing ensures its robustness in real-world scenarios. The model
            offers farmers and agricultural officers a practical tool for early
            diagnosis, enabling timely intervention to reduce crop losses and
            promote sustainable agriculture. Experimental results highlight its
            potential to revolutionize rice disease management in Dakshina
            Kannada and similar regions, paving the way for intelligent
            agricultural systems that enhance productivity and ensure food
            security..
